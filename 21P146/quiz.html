              <b>Quiz refers to a short test of knowledge, typically around 10 questions in length, with question formats often including multiple choice, fill in the blanks, true or false and short answer. A quiz is much shorter than a traditional test or exam and is rarely impactful on a final course grade.
        Professors who employ quizzes in their courses—a practice which is increasingly viable thanks to the broader use of technology in higher ed—may schedule them in each class to ensure students have retained knowledge from the previous lesson. Others may hold pop quizzes, which are surprise tests geared towards making sure students have read course materials and are understanding broader course learnings.
